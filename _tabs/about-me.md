# 👋 Hi, I'm Graham.

I am a Software Engineer, Scrum Master, and fan of being disagreed with. I believe in leadership from all team members, and dedicate time to sharing my ideas - good or bad. I strongly believe that the best teams are those which are empowered to be bad at things. This is safely accomplished by working to limit blast radius.

# 💻 I code.

I am a full-time Software Engineer at [Elentra](https://elentra.com/). We are an Advanced Learning Management System, with roots in a consortium environment. I spend the majority of my day working as a part of a team to build new features for our platform. I'm a big fan of Python, but I believe that using the best tool for the job is more important than my weird snake obsession.

# 🗺️ I lead.

Despite being early in my career as a Software Engineer, I believe in leadership from all levels. I am a Scrum Master at Elentra, and I use this role to advocate for my team and what's best for them. I'm against institutional blockers and always advocate to make the natural path be the correct path. Software Engineers should be lazy, and the environment we foster should be one where being lazy results in the best outcomes.

# 🐈🐕🎲 I also like other things.

I have two cats, Miso and Bean. I love games of all kinds, and like writing to try and capture and make sense of my own thoughts. I live in Ontario, Canada and can be caught pretending to know more about hockey than I really do.
