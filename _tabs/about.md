## 👋 Hi, I'm Graham.

I am a Software Engineer, college professor, and fan of being disagreed with. I believe in leadership from all levels of experience, and dedicate time to sharing my ideas - good or bad. I strongly believe that the best teams are those which are empowered to be bad at things. 

## 💻 I code.

I am a full-time Engineering Manager at [Elentra](https://elentra.com/). We are an Advanced Learning Management System, with roots in a consortium environment. I spend the majority of my day working alongside my coworkers to support them in development on our platform. I'm a big fan of Python, but I believe that using the best tool for the job is more important than my weird snake obsession.

## 🗺️ I lead.

I believe in leadership from all levels. I'm against institutional blockers and always advocate to make the natural path be the correct path. Software Engineers should be lazy, and the environment we foster should be one where being lazy results in the best outcomes.

## 🐈🐕🎲 I also like other things.

I have two cats, Miso and Bean, and a puppy named Tofu! I love games of all kinds, and like writing to try and capture and make sense of my own thoughts. I live in Ontario, Canada and can be caught pretending to know more about hockey than I really do.

Talk to me about anything! The easiest way to get a hold of me is to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/graham-corcoran/).
